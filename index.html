          <p> Hi, I'm Flynn, a 21 year old who values:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning,</li>
            <li>Growth, and,</li>
            <li>Exerting myself.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          Currently, I am completing a degree in Advanced Mathematics, majoring in
          Pure Mathematics, at the University of NSW - now in my fourth and final 
          year.</p>

          <p>I have been fortunate enough to have many cherished experiences from
          around the world. Once the world returns to some sense of familiarity 
          and order, I hope to be in a position where I am passionate about my
          work (maybe <strong>you</strong> could help with that??) and able to enjoy
          the varied experience and growth that comes through travel.</p>

          <p>As you will discover further on, I am an enthusiastic gourmand, endurance
          athlete, and reader.</p>

          <p>To the left, you will see an image from a trip to the 
          hills of Piedmonte in Italy with my dad. I am photographed here with the
          Nebbiolo grapes of my favourite wine, from the town we are overlooking:
          Barolo.</p>

          <p>The image below is from Tokyo in February 2020, when Coronavirus was
          still back-page news of an issue contained within China. The memories of
          the food from this trip have been the inspiration for my recent culinary
          creations.</p>

          <h3>108km Ultra-marathon:</h3>
          <h3>Elephant Trail 2020</h3>
          <p>At 6:30am under dim torchlight on the Saturday
          morning of July 18, Angus Grant (as seen watching me rant) 
          and I began our first ultra-marathon event. At 8:45am 
          on Sunday, we ran under the inflatable Elephant for the
          last time, successfully completing our (personally) portentous 26 
          hour exertion.</p>

          <p>This event was the 
          <a class="etr__link" href="https://www.elephanttrailrace.com.au" target="_blank">Elephant Trail</a> 
          race in Port Macquarie. It consisted in four laps of a

          throughout.</p>

      <p>2021 will be my fourth year studying at the University of NSW, completing
      the requirements for the Advanced Mathematics (Honours), majoring in Pure
      Mathematics, degree.</p>

      <p>Complementing my study of Math, I have undertaken classes in Computer
      Science and public speaking. I value these courses out of the scope of the Math 
      degree as a source of personal growth and interest.</p>


      <h3>Honours Thesis</h3>
      <p>My thesis will be in the field of Combinatorics, focussing on the 
      <a class="etr__link" href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-thomas-britz">Second Neighbourhood Conjecture</a>.
      Throughout this year, I am working with the supervision from the enthusiastic
      <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-thomas-britz" class="etr__link">Dr Thomas Britz</a>.</p>

      <img class="subject__image" src="img/books/math.jpg">

      <h3 class="subject__title">Mathematics</h3>
      <p>Majoring in Pure Mathematics, as one would expect, requires the study of 
      a range of subjects in the vast field. This year, the work on my thesis
      will be accompanied with the following subjects taught by the School of Mathematics:</p>
      <ul class="subject_list">
        <li class="subject_list__class">Modules and Representation Theory,</li>
        <li class="subject_list__class">Graph Theory,</li>
        <li class="subject_list__class">Algebraic Topology,</li>
        <li class="subject_list__class">Functional Analysis, and,</li>
        <li class="subject_list__class">Number Theory.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Outside of the subjects in Pure Mathematics, I have particularly enjoyed 
      my study of the following classes heretofore:</p>
      <ul class="subject_list">
        <li class="subject_list__class">Information, Codes, and Ciphers;</li>
        <li class="subject_list__class">Mathematical Computing for Finance; and,</li>
        <li class="subject_list__class">Higher Topology and Differential Geometry.</li>
      </ul>

      <img class="subject__image" src="img/books/my_term.png">
      <h3 class="subject__title">Computer Science</h3>

      <p>As mentioned (many times) before, I am a passionate programmer, with
      an interest in the efficiency, optimization of algorithms and networking.</p>

      <p>Throughout my degree, I have chosen to undertake many Computer Science
      subjects. Some of the most fulfilling and interesting subjects are listed
      below:</p>

      <ul class="subject_list">
        <li class="subject_list__class">Programming Challenges,</li>
        <li class="subject_list__class">Extended Algorithms and Programming Techniques,</li>
        <li class="subject_list__class">Computer System Fundamentals, and,</li>
        <li class="subject_list__class">Neural Networks and Deep Learning.</li>
      </ul>


      <img class="subject__image" src="img/books/origami_cropped">
      <h3 class="subject__title">Miscellaneous</h3>
      <p>My intellectual growth extends beyond these two areas of focus: exploring
      my curiosity for effective communication and presentation, learning about
      the terroir of my favourite vineyards, and pursuing the perfect coffee.</p>
      <p>Reading the published work of psychiatrist Eric Berne, analysing the
      methods of storytelling used by my favourite authors, and actively
      participating and reflecting on my own conversations help me understand
      the foundations of effective (and destructive) communication.</p>
      <p>Regarding wine, referring to the books of Jancis Robinson, enjoying
      documentaries on the industry, vineyard websites, and plenty of 
      conversations expand my knowledge on the subject.</p>
      <p>Finally, with my barista's certificate - acknowledging me as a professional
      amateur hehe - I start every morning brewing espresso and piccolo's to enjoy,
      whilst (quietly) perfecting my art.</p>

      <p class="reading__intro">As an armchair philosopher, my reading journey
      began by voraciously engaging with the works of Friedrich Nietzche. Since
      those beginnings, I have found that I am fond of the lessons and experiences
      within the classic novels, but in particular the Russian classics. Every
      time I adventure into some other fiction, I enjoy the journey, but am
      pleasantly surprised when I return to the wealth found with Dostoyevsky
      or Nietzche.</p>

                for many of the works of Dostoyevsky and Bulgagov, it was only
                a matter of time before I read this corner stone of Russian 
                literature. The story walks through the misadventures of a Russian
                con-man. Written with a very casual tone, Gogol explores the timeless
                personalities of his characters: people we are familiar with and
                would meet in our own misadventures.

                knowledge about Russian authors without enjoying the complementary
                writing of Tolstoy. This is a grand story, which has been 
                magniloquently written. 650 pages in, I have been enjoying this
                extensive story and am about to begin the essay's Tolstoy
